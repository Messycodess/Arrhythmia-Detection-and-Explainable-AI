Our project compared four deep-learning models for ECG beat classification using the MIT-BIH dataset (AAMI 5-class scheme). The results show:
ResNet18-1D: 99.01% (best performance)
1D-CNN: 98.61%
InceptionTime: 96.16%
MiniXception1D: 93.35%
ResNet18-1D achieved the highest accuracy due to its strong feature extraction with residual connections. Grad-CAM visualization confirmed that the model focuses on clinically meaningful ECG regions such as the QRS complex and abnormal ventricular shapes.
